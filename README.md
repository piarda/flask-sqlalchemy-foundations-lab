# Flask-SQLAlchemy Lab 1

This project is a Flask-based backend service designed to store and serve global earthquake data. It provides API endpoints to query earthquake information by event ID or by minimum magnitude.

## Features:
- Stores earthquake data securely using SQLite and SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Provides RESTful API endpoints to:
    Retrieve earthquake data by ID.
    Retrieve earthquakes with a magnitude above a given threshold.
- Returns responses in JSON format for easy frontend integration.
- Database migrations handled with Flask-Migrate.
- Seed script to populate the database with initial data.
- Includes automated tests using Pytest.

## Setup and Installation:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the server directory.
2. Install dependencies and activate the virtual environment:
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
3. Set environment variables:
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
4. Initialize and migrate the database:
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
    flask db upgrade head
5. Seed the database with initial earthquake data:
    python seed.py
6. Run the Flask server:
    flask run

## API Endpoints:
GET /earthquakes/<int:id>

## Overview

At your new role as a junior backend developer at Seismic Analytics Co., your 
team is building a new internal tool to manage global earthquake data. Until 
now, the data was tracked manually in spreadsheets — causing duplicate records, 
missing information, and delays when scientists needed to access accurate seismic 
history. The organization needs a web-based backend that:

* Stores earthquake data securely.
* Allows fast queries based on event ID or magnitude.
* Returns results in a structured JSON format so that frontend tools (maps, graphs) can dynamically visualize the data.

This lab simulates a realistic project where you'll:

* Define a database model for earthquakes.
* Set up database migrations to create and maintain the database.
* Seed the database with real sample data.
* Write API routes to query and return earthquake information as JSON.

You’ll apply the same problem-solving process used in professional development:

* Define the problem and requirements.
* Determine the technical design.
* Develop, test, and refine your solution incrementally.

## Setup

Fork and clone the lab repo.

Run `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell` .

```console
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

Change into the `server` directory and configure the `FLASK_APP` and
`FLASK_RUN_PORT` environment variables:

```console
$ cd server
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5555
```

## Instructions

### Task 1: Define the Problem

Seismic Analytics Co. needs a reliable backend service that stores earthquake 
event data and provides a way to retrieve:

* A specific earthquake by its ID.
* A list of earthquakes that meet a minimum magnitude threshold.

Manual spreadsheet tracking is unreliable and unscalable. The backend must 
expose simple, efficient API endpoints that:

* Query the database for earthquakes based on user input.
* Return results in JSON format for easy frontend integration.

You must ensure that:

* The database is properly structured and version-controlled using migrations.
* The application can be seeded with initial earthquake data.
* Queries can efficiently filter large datasets.
* The API returns clear 200 or 404 responses depending on the search results.

### Task 2: Determine the Design

The technical design for this application will include:

* Database Model:
  * Define an Earthquake model with appropriate fields (id, magnitude, location, year) using SQLAlchemy ORM.
* Database Migration:
  * Use Flask-Migrate to initialize the database and create the earthquakes table via migration scripts.
* Seeding:
  * A seed.py script is included to insert a realistic set of earthquake records for development and testing purposes.
* API Routes:
  * GET /earthquakes/int:id — Retrieve a single earthquake by ID. Return a 404 JSON error if not found.
  * GET /earthquakes/magnitude/float:magnitude — Retrieve all earthquakes above a given magnitude, returning a count and list in JSON format.
* Testing:
  * Use Pytest to validate that models, migrations, and routes behave correctly.
  * Ensure database queries are efficient and handle missing records gracefully.


### Task 3: Develop, Test, and Refine the Code

#### Step 1: Define a model

Edit `server/models.py` to add a new model class named `Earthquake` that
inherits from `db.Model`.

Add the following attributes to the `Earthquake` model:

- a string named `__tablename__` assigned to the value `"earthquakes"`.
- a column named `id` to store an int that is the primary key.
- a column named `magnitude` to store a float.
- a column named `location` to store a string.
- A column named `year` to store an int.

Add a `__repr__` method to return a string that formats the attributes id,
magnitude, location, and year as a comma-separated sequence as shown:

```text
<Earthquake 1, 9.5, Chile, 1960>
```

Save `server/models.py`. Make sure you are in the `server` directory, then type
the following to test the new `Earthquake` model class:

```console
$ pytest testing/models_test.py
```

The 4 tests should pass. If not, update your `Earthquake` model to pass the
tests before proceeding.

#### Step 2: Initialize the database

Now it is time to create a database named `app.db` with a table named
`earthquakes`.

Execute the following commands within the `server` directory:

```console
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
```

The `instance` and `migrations` folder should appear with the database file and
a migration script.

Let's run the migration to create the `earthquakes` table:

```console
flask db upgrade head
```

Take a look at the file `seed.py`:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# server/seed.py

from app import app
from models import db, Earthquake

with app.app_context():

    # Delete all rows in the "earthquakes" table
    Earthquake.query.delete()

    # Add several Earthquake instances to the "earthquakes" table
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=9.5, location="Chile", year=1960))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=9.2, location="Alaska", year=1964))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=8.6, location="Alaska", year=1946))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=8.5, location="Banda Sea", year=1934))
    db.session.add(Earthquake(magnitude=8.4, location="Chile", year=1922))

    # Commit the transaction
    db.session.commit()

```

Run the following command within the `server` directory to seed the table:

```console
python seed.py
```

Use the Flask shell to confirm the 5 earthquakes have been added and id's have
been assigned. Your output may differ depending on your implementation of the
`__repr__()` method:

```command
$ flask shell
>>> Earthquake.query.all()
[<Earthquake 1, 9.5, Chile, 1960>, <Earthquake 2, 9.2, Alaska, 1964>, <Earthquake 3, 8.6, Alaska, 1946>, <Earthquake 4, 8.5, Banda Sea, 1934>, <Earthquake 5, 8.4, Chile, 1922>]
```

In the next step, you will implement views to query by id and filter by
magnitude. But first you should practice some Flask-SQLAlchemy functions in the
Flask shell.

Recall the `filter_by()` function selects rows having a specific value for a
column. For example, to select the row matching a specific id `5`:

```console
>>> Earthquake.query.filter_by(id=5).first()
<Earthquake 5, 8.4, Chile, 1922>
```

The `filter()` function selects rows matching a boolean expression. You can also
use it to match a specific id:

```console
>>> Earthquake.query.filter(Earthquake.id==5).first()
<Earthquake 5, 8.4, Chile, 1922>
```

Note that the `filter_by()` function can only test for equality. Use the
`filter()` function if you need to use a different relational operator. For
example, to get all quakes with a magnitude of at least 8.6, you need to use
`filter()` with a boolean expression using the `>=` operator:

```console
>>> Earthquake.query.filter(Earthquake.magnitude >= 8.6).all()
[<Earthquake 1, 9.5, Chile, 1960>, <Earthquake 2, 9.2, Alaska, 1964>, <Earthquake 3, 8.6, Alaska, 1946>]
```

Exit out of Flask shell and move on to the next task.

```console
>>> exit()
```

#### Step 3: Add view to get an earthquake by id

Edit `app.py` to add a view that takes one parameter, an integer that represents
an id. The route should have the form `/earthquakes/<int:id>`.

The view should query the database to get the earthquake with that id, and
return a response containing the model attributes and values (id, location,
magnitude, year) formatted as an JSON string. The response should include an
error message if no row is found. Don't forget to import `Earthquake` from the
`models` module.

For example, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/2 should result in a
response with a 200 status and a body containing JSON formatted text as shown:

```text
{
  "id": 2,
  "location": "Alaska",
  "magnitude": 9.2,
  "year": 1964
}
```

However, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/9999 should result in a
response with a 404 status and a body containing JSON formatted text as shown:

```text
{
  "message": "Earthquake 9999 not found."
}
```

Test the route by typing the following within the `server` directory (make sure
the Flask server is running):

```console
pytest testing/app_earthquake_test.py
```

Make sure the 4 tests pass.

#### Step 4: Add view to get earthquakes matching a minimum magnitude value

Edit `app.py` to add a view that takes one parameter, a float that represents an
magnitude. The route should have the form
`/earthquakes/magnitude/<float:magnitude>`.

The view should query the database to get all earthquakes having a magnitude
greater than or equal to the parameter value, and return a JSON response
containing the count of matching rows along with a list containing the data for
each row.

For example, the URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/magnitude/9.0 should
result in a response with a 200 status and a body containing JSON formatted text
as shown:

```text
{
  "count": 2,
  "quakes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "location": "Chile",
      "magnitude": 9.5,
      "year": 1960
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "location": "Alaska",
      "magnitude": 9.2,
      "year": 1964
    }
  ]
}
```

The URL http://127.0.0.1:5555/earthquakes/magnitude/10.0 should result in a
response with a 200 status and a body containing JSON formatted text as shown:

```text
{
  "count": 0,
  "quakes": []
}
```

Test the route by typing the following within the `server` directory:

```console
pytest testing/app_magnitude_test.py
```

Make sure the tests pass.
